# Sim4SpecTerms

Sim4SpecTerms stands for "Simulator for spectroscopic terms". This project is a 
rewrite of the existing 
[SimulatorForSpectroscopicTerms-C](https://github.com/201st-Luka/SimulatorForSpectroscopicTerms-C) project, but this 
time using Python 3.11 and `Flask` to create a nice UI.

## Features

This website is a simulator for spectroscopic terms and simulates every possible state of a given electron 
configuration to obtain a list of term symbols for this configuration.
